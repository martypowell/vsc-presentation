# Visual Studio Code Text Editor

## What Is It?
Free online text editor. Tailored towards development, but is flexible for other purposes.

## Disclaimer
I AM NOT SAYING YOU HAVE TO USE THIS TOOL OR SAYING IT'S BETTER THAN OTHER TOOLS OUT THERE. I had a reason to try it and it has replaced another text editor that cost money nicely.
